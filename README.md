# Jti Test Extension

This extension is published using GitHub Pages and can be found [here](https://sensory-minds.github.io/jti-test-extension/).

As this extension does not really connect to the SDK, it runs in `mock: true` mode. Therefore the returned data is arbitrary and not consistent in itself.

For further information on how to use the SDK in your own extension, find the [client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jti-extensions/client) and [types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jti-extensions/types) packages on npm.
